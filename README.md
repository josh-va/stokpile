# stokpile

**stokpile** is an Android mobile application built with Flutter.  
This repository serves as the starting point for the application's development.

stokpile is a Flutter-based Android application designed to encourage users to give up small indulgences, such as coffee or snacks, and pool the money that they would have spent on these to get themselves a larger reward.

stokpile allows users to easily record and track any 'no thanks' moments, how much money they have saved by saying no, and then track presents they've given themself with this saved money.

stokpile does not actually hold, control, or have any access to user's money - rather it is incumbent on the user to input their savings and their presents.

This is an ongoing first project for me that I've been playing around with to get a handle on the app development process and performing some self-directed learning along the way.

My plan is to eventually get this application to a point where it has full basic functionality and can be hosted on the Google Play store.

In the meantime, should you want to demo the application, instructions on how to set it up locally are below.
